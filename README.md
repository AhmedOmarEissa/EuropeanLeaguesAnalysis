# European Leagues Analysis

This is an analysis created for Udacity advanced data analysis nano degree, the goal is to provide basic analysis on any dataset. 

Using [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) on kaggle, the dataset contains data for European leagues matches between 2008 - 2016. 



## Key question

**How does age affect players performance?** 

To answer this question, I've used the player rating as an indication of the performance, tracking the change % in player rating against his own average rating across different ages, then plot the average change % for all the players in the dataset.

## Key finding
Players are on top of their game between 24 - 32 years with 2.5% increase in their rating vs their own average. 

## What next? 
If I have more time on the future, I like to create a tool where user can add the player features and current rating, and the tool predict what are the areas will see improvement in performance and what areas are expected to decline in performance
